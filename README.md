# OpenTansu
OpenTansu is open DIY Eurorack case project


## Overview

This is a Eurorack case project made using a 3D printer.
All are open source and the recipes are published. Musicians of the future will be able to start playing immediately by buying modules and power supplies.

Originally started from my experimental inquisitive mind, I just want people who don't have the money or Eurorack users who have different ideas to join us.

Build your modular case by 3D printing your favorite parts.
And share your ideas!
My modeling is done in SketchUp (because it's my favorite CAD!), But your design should be supported, whether it's Fusion or Solidworks.

The fitting gap of all parts is 0.1 mm on one side.
However, I don't think this is the correct answer. This is because I think it will change depending on the model of the 3D printer, the material of the filament, and the room temperature.
For reference, I used Mark forged's Mark One and Onyx.

As a design concept, I would like to try not to use glue as much as possible.
